# 🦎 Cameleon

**Cameleon** is a powerful canvas-driven tool for generating and managing Camel, REST and GraphQL schemas. Designed for adaptability—like the chameleon it’s named after—Cameleon empowers developers to visually design APIs, transform data structures, and integrate seamlessly with modern backend architectures. Inspired by Apache Camel, it brings schema design into a dynamic, intuitive visual space.

## 🚀 Features

**Canvas-Based API Design**
Design REST and GraphQL schemas using a visual drag-and-drop interface. Define endpoints, relationships, and transformations directly on a canvas.

**Dual Schema Support**
Generate both REST (OpenAPI/Swagger) and GraphQL (SDL) schemas from a single visual source.

**Apache Camel Integration Concepts**
Follows messaging and integration patterns inspired by Apache Camel, supporting transformation logic and routing concepts.

**Live Preview & Export**
Instantly preview your schema structure and export to industry-standard formats like JSON, YAML, and GraphQL SDL.

**Plugin-Friendly Architecture**
Extend functionality through custom plugins, schema transformers, and export formats.

## 📦 Installation

Cameleon is currently under development and will be available through CLI and Docker.

Planned installation methods include:
- Global CLI via npm
- Dockerized app for quick local usage
- Cloud-hosted version for teams

---

## 🛠️ Usage

Launch the app to open the canvas editor in your browser. Use the canvas to define:
- REST endpoints or GraphQL queries/mutations
- Input/output data models
- Transformation logic between services

Export your schema into deployable formats or use it as a source of truth for documentation and backend implementation.
